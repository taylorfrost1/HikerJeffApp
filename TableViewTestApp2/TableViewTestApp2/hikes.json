The elevation change is 500 feet down from the rim and 500 feet to come back out.  There are unearthly like fins, spires, hoodoos, domes, pinnacles and of course deep pockets in the sandstone ranging in size from bath tub to Olympic swimming pool.  This trail is especially attractive after a recent storm to enjoy the added water photography.",

It’s about 10 miles and includes a petro glyph panel with bear paws demonstrating the long migrations that the ancients made from the deserts to mountains.

It is considered one of the top hikes on the planet as it winds through sandstone up to 300 feet deep and shoulder width in some places.  This has to be hiked with 0 percent precipitation forecast.

Thunder River requires descending 3,000 feet in 9 miles and returning in the same day.  Because of the extreme temperatures in the summer we will only be doing this hike in the spring and fall.",
